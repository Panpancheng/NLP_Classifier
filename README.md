# NLP_Classifier
• Name: Panpan Cheng and email address: pc2756@columbia.edu.

• Homework number: hw1.

• Information on how to train and test your classifier: 
  classify.py only has the best model, which is the Naive Bayes unigram model. 
  The input is train_newline.txt(train data) and dev_newline.txt(test data). First train the model on the train data and test the classifier
  on test data.
  The output are acurracy of the classifier, model.pkl(the best model) and test.pkl(vectorized test data) 
  
  analyze.py analyzes the model on the test data and output the top 20 features and contingency table.
  
  hw1.py get the accuracy, top 20 features and contingency table of the best model and Naive Bayes unigram model, SVM bigram model and Naive Bayes trigram model.
  
  
• Limitation of your classifier: My classifier doesn't consider the sentiment feature.
